Safety and Security
Safety is a top priority at The University of Kansas Health System and everywhere on the University of Kansas Medical Center and health system campus. University of Kansas police officers regularly patrol campus and are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

A safe place for healing
The University of Kansas Health System is committed to providing a safe environment for patients, visitors and staff. We have zero tolerance for violence and will not tolerate violent or aggressive behavior of any kind, including:

Damaging health system property
Physical assault or inappropriate touching
Stalking
Throwing items
Verbal harassment and threats
If necessary, we will notify the police, and this may result in prosecution. We appreciate your cooperation and respect.

Escorts to your vehicle
A University of Kansas police officer is available to escort you to your car after dark. To request an escort from any hospital phone, call 8-5030. Or call from your cell phone, 913-588-5030.

Emergency phones
To reach police in an emergency, use the light-blue phones located throughout the campus. You will automatically be connected to the University of Kansas Police Department when you pick up the receiver. You may also dial 911 from any phone.

Emergency and fire drills
The hospital schedules regular fire and emergency safety drills to ensure staff respond calmly and efficiently to any situation that affects your safety. When a drill begins, you will hear a bell or alarm sound. A staff member will let you know if an actual emergency arises and you need to follow safety protocols.

Cell phones
Using cell phones may not be allowed in some patient care areas. Ask nursing staff before using your cell phone in these areas.

Personal items
Because the hospital is not responsible for replacing missing or damaged personal belongings, we encourage you to leave cash, credit cards, jewelry and other valuables at home.
